# DJ Michael Toor Website

![Example screenshot](../images/MichaelToorLogo.png)

> As my first full stack project with node.js, this dJ website allows the dj to advertise himself by presenting his music, bio, personal studio and his performed gigs to potential clients. A client can contact the dj through the website if his services are desired.

## Technologies
* Node.js - version 14.5.0
* MySQL - version 2.17.1
* Bootstrap 4 - version 4.1.1

## Launch
Website link to deployed app on Heroku: https://djmichaeltoor.herokuapp.com/

## Features
This website incorporates:
* User authentication for the owner to manage the website
* The Nodemailer module for clients to contact the dJ via email 
* A MySQL database for storing all the dJ's gigs. The database can be appended to or edited through the owner's user options
* A callender module for client and owner interaction to the database

## Status
This website is no longer in use by the owner since he is now a producer and no longer strictly a dj. The deployed app on Heroku is just for demonstration purposes.
