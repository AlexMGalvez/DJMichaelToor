> As my first full stack project with node.js, this dj website allows the dj to advertise himself by presenting his music, bio, personal studio and his performed gigs to potential clients.

## Technologies
* Node.js - version 14.5.0
* MySQL - version 2.17.1
* Bootstrap 4 - version 4.1.1

## Launch
Website link to deployed app on Heroku: https://djmichaeltoor.herokuapp.com/

## Features
This website includes:
* User authentication and the use of sessions for the owner to manage his website
* The Nodemailer module which allows clients to contact the dj via email 
* A MySQL database for storing all the dj's gigs. The database can be appended to or edited through the owner's user options
* A calendar module for client and owner interaction with the database
* Security measures taken into account regarding brute force attack prevention, password hashing and preventing SQL injection

## Status
This website is no longer in use by the owner since he is now a producer and no longer a dj. The deployed app on Heroku is just for demonstration purposes.
